# nifH_microbial_drivers
A data pipeline used to search metagenomes for a gene of interest using a reference database/alignment. 
Jupyter notebooks were used for manual curation of protein sequence collections from outputs of an iterative HMMER search run with Snakemake. 
This pipeline was applied in a searh for nitrogen genes (i.e. nifH) in Tara Oceans metagenomes created by the Alexander Lab at WHOI. 
A list of relevant jupyter notebooks and how they relate to the rest of the analysis is below.
